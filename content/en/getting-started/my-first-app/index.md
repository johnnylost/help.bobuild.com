This tutorial will guide you through the basic steps needed for creating your first app. The process is easy: first you define the objects that your app will handle, and then you build the pages that will let users browse and manipulate such data.

### Step one: give a name to your app

Just [enter Bobuild](https://my.bobuild.com) and click the "Create app" button.

Choose a short app name. This will be used as the app domain: `https://APPNAME.bobuild.com/`

Now you need to go through two steps:

1. Design your database
2. Design your application pages

## Design your database

This step is easy. You define the objects and the fields that you want to store in your database.

An object is just an entity: for example, `customer`, `product`, or `order`.

Start creating your objects by clicking the *Add Object* button:

You'll be prompted for the object name:

Now you need to define one or more object fields. Think about fields as the columns of a spreadsheet: they define the properties of your object. For example, a `customer` may have these fields: `name`, `lastname`, `address`, `email` and many more.
When you create an object, the `id` field will be created for you: it's a special field that you cannot change or delete. It's automatically populated with an incrementing number identifying the record uniquely.
Now add your first field by clicking the *Add Field* button:

![](fields.png)

You will be prompted for the field name and type. Choose the type that best describes the data you'll put in this field:

Repeat this step for all the desired fields.

For the purpose of this tutorial we're going to create the fields used to store some typical customer data: Last Name, Name, E-mail and Address.

Please note that you can select a field type different from text, as E-mail, and the semantic of the field will be changed accordingly (we will deepen this point later on).

Now that we have our first object ready, let's create a page to fill in the data of our customers.

## Design your page

As done before with the the Object, this time click the *Add Page* button:

![](add_page.png)

Specify the page name:

![](add_page_dialog.png)

Ignore for the moment the message "This page is not protected by a login.". We will see how to create a login page in a future tutorial.

To the right you can find a list of the many views you can add to the page. Each view consists in a different way to process and display in a page the informations about an object.

As we want to create a form to fill in customer data. drag the *Form* view to the empty page.

![](form_view_drag.png)

Confirm that this form will create a new record in the *Customer* object.

![](form_customer_dialog.png)

To set the details of the form, click on its empty space.

![](form_view_blank.png)

In the new dialog, you can find to the right the list of the fileds of the Object *Customer* that you've linked the form to. Let's first create a Group clicking the *Group* button. A group is a container for one or more fields of the form.

![](form_main.png)

Now you can drag the fields of the Object to the Group you've just created. Let's start with Last Name

![](form_fields_drag.png)

Do the same for all the other fields: Name, E-mail and Address. Do not forget to add a "Submit" button as well, so you can submit the data once filled in the form. And - voil√† - our form is ready! We will see how to customize it with titles and other stuff in the future, but it's already functioning.

![](first_form.png)

Click the "Close this dialog" button on the upper right side of the page and return to the previous screen. Here, you will see a preview of the page with the form you've just created.

Click the *Launch Preview* button an it will open a new browser tab with the form, ready to be used. Try to fill in some data and create some customer.

![](form_filled_in.png)

Note that if you insert an e-mail address that is formally wrong it won't be accepted.

Objects have relationships among them: each **order** belongs to a single **customer**, while each **product** may be associated with **multiple orders**.
